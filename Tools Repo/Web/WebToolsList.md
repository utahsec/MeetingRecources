* Burp Suite: Burp Suite has tools for intercepting traffic, automating attacks, and performing manual testing. [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
* Nmap: Short for Network Mapper, nmap is an open source, command-line tool that can scan the open ports on a network and also provide information on the utilized applications (http server, SQL server, email server, shh, etc...). An invaluable and **essential** tool. [Nmap](nmap.org)
* gobuster: Another cli tool, used to enumerate directories on a website and see those that might be hidden away or obfuscated. [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)
* JohnTheRipper: A hash-cracking software that's good for more than just web exploitation. However, there's a user, and they have an encrypted password. We need something to get past it. [JohnTheRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
* Metasploit: Used for MUCH more than just web exploition, this framework of tools allows you to hit a target login or admin portal with a multitude of attacks. This tool istquite literally a swiss-army knife with 1000 tools, it needs it's own wiki page, or better, its own website! [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)
* ExploitDB: Often, websites will use a webserver like Nginx , or a Content Management System like WordPress. The software a site is depended on may have vulnerablities that we can exploit. ExploitDB offers a public database of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that very often explain how to exploit the service and/or include code to achieve exploitation. In addition, this database exists both online and as a git clone, so that you can keep and search all the exploits locally on your own machine. [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
* Wfuzz: Like gobuster, but does a bit more. While it can enumerate directories, it can also help automate attacks. [Wfuzz](https://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Chrome/Firefox/Arc Devtools: The first line of offense. Turn on devtools and search the source code for clues.
